== Site Plotter ==

Designed for underwater archaeology. Takes a list of measurements, and plots the
matching points on a canvas.

Points can be entered based on:
- Baseline / offset measurements (e.g. 3m along the baseline, 2m to the left)
- Trigonometric measurements (e.g. 3m from point A, 5m from point B)
- Bearing measurements (e.g. 270 degrees from point A, 5m)

Next versions plan to:
* draw shapes, for better-looking maps
* add more primary points, add measurements based on any two primary points as a baseline
* handle levation?
* look better? Colors? Optional grids? Isometric 3D view?
