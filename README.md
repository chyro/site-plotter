== Site Plotter ==

Designed for underwater archaeology. Takes a list of measurements, and plots the
matching points on a canvas.

Alpha version takes the points from JS directly. Next versions plan to:
* draw shapes, for better-looking maps
* provide a browser interface to enter points
* add more primary points, add measurements based on any two primary points as a baseline
* handle more measurements types / topographies? Elevation?
* look better? Colors? Optional grids? Isometric 3D view?
